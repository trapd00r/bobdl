Me and my girl uses a boxeebox named bob. Having to check if there's a
new $episode foreach $show is getting increasingly daunting.

Here's a solution since flexget was way too complicated:

- We populate the showrss feed with every show we watch.
  The base url doesn't change, only the content.
- We parse that dreadful xml and extract the magnet uri for each entry.
- The magnet uri is converted to a torrent file so we can auto-load it in rtorrent

= our friend Bob is always populated with new content and I never have
  to check manually ever again.
